# Stock Price Prediction using LSTM
# Summary
This project aims to predict stock prices using a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network. Leveraging historical stock price data from Yahoo Finance, specifically for Apple's (AAPL) stock, the project demonstrates the application of LSTM in time series forecasting within the financial domain.

# Introduction
Stock price prediction is a crucial aspect of financial markets, enabling investors and analysts to make informed decisions. Traditional methods often struggle with capturing the complex temporal dependencies in stock data. LSTM networks, a type of recurrent neural network (RNN), are well-suited for this task due to their ability to remember long-term dependencies.

# Project Overview
Data Collection
The project utilizes historical stock price data for Apple Inc. (AAPL) sourced from Yahoo Finance. The data spans from January 2010 to January 2020, including key attributes such as the closing price, which is used for prediction.

# Data Preprocessing
Data preprocessing involves:

Filtering the relevant 'Close' price column.

Scaling the data to a range between 0 and 1 using MinMaxScaler to improve model performance.

Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.
# Model Building
The LSTM model is built using the Keras library and consists of:

Two LSTM layers with 50 units each.

A Dense layer with 25 units.

A final Dense layer with 1 unit for output.

The model is compiled with the Adam optimizer and mean squared error as the loss function.
# Training and Prediction
The model is trained on the training dataset, and predictions are made on the testing dataset. The training involves learning the patterns in the historical data to predict future stock prices.

# Results Visualization
The project visualizes the model's performance by plotting the actual stock prices against the predicted prices. This comparison helps in evaluating the accuracy and reliability of the LSTM model.

# Conclusion
This project demonstrates the effectiveness of LSTM networks in predicting stock prices. By capturing long-term dependencies in the data, LSTM models provide a robust approach to time series forecasting in the financial sector.
